***************** ABSTRACT DATA TYPE *******************

We know that we have in-built data types such as => int , float , char etc. In which we want to perform some operations like => addition , substraction , multiplication. But there might be a situation in which we want to perform some operations for our user defined data types which we have defined.To resolve this problem , we create a data structure along with some basic operations and data structure which are not in-built are known as abstract data type.

Abstract data type is a type (or class) for objects whose behaviour is defined by a set of values and a set of operations.The definition of ADT only mentions that what operations are to be performed but not how these operations will be implemented.

The process of providing only essentials and hiding the details is known as abstraction.
